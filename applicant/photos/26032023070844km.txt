Q1. Define Artificial intelligence on the basis of “System that think rationally” and “System that act 
like humans”. 
 On the basis of "System that thinks rationally", Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the ability 
of machines to mimic human cognitive functions such as reasoning, problem-solving, and 
decision-making. This means that machines can perform tasks by following logical rules and 
making deductions based on available data. AI systems that think rationally are typically 
used in applications such as expert systems, where the system is designed to provide advice 
or recommendations based on a set of rules or knowledge. 
 On the basis of "System that act like humans", AI refers to the ability of machines to perform 
tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as perception, speech recognition, and 
natural language processing. This means that machines can interact with humans in a way 
that is natural and intuitive, allowing them to understand and respond to human commands 
and requests. AI systems that act like humans are typically used in applications such as 
chatbots, virtual assistants, and robots. 
Q2. Differentiate between Natural (Human) Intelligence & Artificial Intelligence. 
 Natural Intelligence is the cognitive ability of human beings to perceive, reason, learn, and 
adapt to new situations. It is a complex and dynamic process that involves a combination of 
innate abilities and learned skills, as well as environmental and social factors. 
 Artificial Intelligence is the simulation of human intelligence in machines that can perform 
tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as perception, reasoning, and decisionmaking. AI systems are designed to mimic human cognitive functions, but they do not have 
the same level of complexity and adaptability as natural intelligence. 
Q3. What is Weak AI and Strong AI? 
 Weak AI, also known as narrow or applied AI, refers to machines that can perform a specific 
task or a set of tasks that are programmed by humans. These systems are designed to solve 
specific problems and are not capable of general intelligence. Examples of weak AI include 
image recognition systems, voice assistants, and recommender systems. 
 Strong AI, also known as artificial general intelligence (AGI), refers to machines that can 
perform any intellectual task that a human can do. These systems would have the ability to 
reason, learn, and adapt to new situations, and would be capable of general intelligence. 
Strong AI is still a theoretical concept and has not yet been achieved.
